# Intnl-Calling-Skill
An Amazon Alexa Skill for international calling codes. Users can request a location, and learn the location's calling code. Or they can request an international calling code, and learn the code's location.

A couple example utterances include:
- What's the calling code for Spain?
- Where is code plus three four calling from?

The dataTransfer folder contains the JSON data and Javascript code that I used to upload my data to AWS DynamoDB. It took me awhile to figure out this process, so I hope it can help other developers.
